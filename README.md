# Jetson Character Haar-clasifier-imagine-2015

This repository was used to create a Haar cascade for various Jetson characters

This classifier was used in conjuction with a Parrot AR Drone running a node.js program.
It was used as a part of Imagine RIT's Flying Car Challenge and placed 2nd overall.

Special thanks to Trevor Sherrad for all the help.
